Made following [this guide](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/)

To run you will need to need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

You will need to let node download the necessary libraries:
`npm install discord.io winston â€“save`
`npm install https://github.com/woor/discord.io/tarball/gateway_v6`

Finally you will need to generate your own auth token to place in the `auth.json` file (see the article)
